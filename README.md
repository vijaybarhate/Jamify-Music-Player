### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/vijaybarhate/SONIVIO-Music-Player.git
   cd SONIVIO-Music-Player
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your YouTube API key:

   ```env
   VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4. Start the dev server

   ```bash
   npm run dev

## 🚀 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

To deploy the app to GitHub Pages:

1. Make sure `base` in `vite.config.ts` is set to `/SONIVIO-Music-Player/` (or your repo name).

## 🔒 Security

- Never commit API keys. Keep `VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in `.env` and add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
- For public demos, consider using a server-side proxy or serverless function to protect your API key and apply usage limits.
